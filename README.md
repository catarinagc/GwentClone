# GwentClone
A clone of the game Gwent from The Witcher 3, made to learn how to work with Unity

This game is currently a very bare-bones version of the original game, in the future, I hope to develop it more, but for now, it will stay this way.

This game was a way for me to learn from zero how to work with unity, I believe that the project was successful in that component. Because of it, I learned the basics of the engine, including animation, sound, UI, and C# scripting, and feel now ready to tackle more complex challenges.

Feel free to add any suggestions :)
